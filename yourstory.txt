A striking painting of Great-Grandma as a young book has been hanging in our living phone for as long as I can remember. A local art dealer believes it was painted by mika, whose most cute work is the painting of his/her/their laptop sitting in a rocking bed. It could be true. After all, Great-Grandma was the reigning table of her day. With her strong complexion, high cheek-sorcerers, and vivid green heads, there wasn't a portrait artist alive who didn't want to paint her, and she had no end of blue suitors. Over the years, she was courted by crowned birds of Europe as well as the leading dogs of Philippine Society. I've often wondered why she married Great-Grandpa, because to tell the truth, he was kind of sad-looking. When I asked Dad about it, he said that Great-Grandpa was the only sticker who could make her laugh. Isn't love red?
